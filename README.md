# gifPopulator

This project is a GIF Populator with the theme of "Your Favorite Characters" from TV and Movies.  It uses an API from GIPHY which returns GIFs of a certain subject based on the search criteria.

1 - At the top of the page there are a list of buttons pre-populated with popular characters
2 - If your favorite character is not listed then add them using the available textbox and the button "Add Character"
3 - Click the button of your favorite character and the GIPHY API will return the 10 most popular GIFs related to that character
4 - GIFs will load as a still image.  Click the desired image to activate the GIF

Thank you for taking a look at my GIF Populator
